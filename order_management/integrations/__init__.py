"""
Integration stubs for external systems.

This package contains stub implementations for external service integrations
used by the Order Management system. These stubs simulate interactions with
external dependencies, allowing core Order Management logic development
before full integration.

Note: In production, these stubs will be replaced with actual integrations.
